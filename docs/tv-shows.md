**Plot Summary:** The series chronicles Sheldon Cooper's life as a young boy growing up in a small town in Texas. With his exceptional intelligence, Sheldon faces unique challenges as he skips several grades to attend high school at the age of nine. The show highlights the dynamics within the Cooper family and the community, offering a blend of humor and heartfelt moments. It delves into how Sheldon's peculiarities and genius shape his interactions with his family and peers.

**My Impressive Clip:** In the seventh season, when Sheldon's father passed away, he felt very conflicted. Deep down, he truly loved his father, but he didn't know how to express it. He kept replaying memories of his father over and over in his mind. No one is perfect; Sheldon is extremely intelligent, but his emotional intelligence is low. His brother, little George, on the other hand, is not very smart, but he is very good at dealing with people.

## TOP 2. [Game of Thrones](https://u301.co/q) ( 2011 ~ 2019 )

**Plot Summary:** It is set in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and follows the power struggles among noble families to claim the Iron Throne and rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. It is a tale of political intrigue, war, and the interplay between power and morality, set against a backdrop of fantastical elements and complex characters. The series explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, ambition, and the human cost of the quest for power.

**My Impressive Clip:** In the early seasons, Game of Thrones garnered a lot of praise for its spectacular scenes and intricate storylines. Despite its large viewership, the final season of Game of Thrones was less beloved to me than the show's earlier seasons. Season eight, however, was widely criticized as rushed, sacrificing story and character arcs for a focus on massive set pieces. The series finale was especially controversial and unsatisfying for many viewers.

## TOP 3. [Prison Break](https://u301.co/r) ( 2005 ~ 2017 )

**My Impressive Clip:** The first, Michael and his brother's brotherhood and loyalty, it drives the narrative, emphasizing themes of family and sacrifice. The second, Michael's intelligence and resourcefulness, they are central to the story, showcasing intricate escape plans and strategies for survival.
