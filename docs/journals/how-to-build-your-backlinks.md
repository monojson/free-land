# How To Build Your Backlinks
> The higher the quality and quantity of backlinks pointing to your site, the more trustworthy it can seem.

## Main Factors
### Authority
Generally, the more authoritative the referring (linking) site, the more valuable the backlink.
- **Link power**: The quality and quantity of backlinks to the site
- **Organic traffic**: The estimated number of unpaid search engine visits the site gets each month
- **Natural profile**: How natural (i.e., not spammy) the site’s backlink profile appears to be
  
### Relevance
It’s usually better to build SEO links from sites that are highly related to your own.
Let’s say you have three backlinks to your basketball shoes range:
- **Backlink 1**: appears on a gardening website in an article about growing plants. It’s unlikely to carry much SEO weight (if any), because the site and topic are so unrelated to you. 
- **Backlink 2**: appears on a sports blog in a post about cardiovascular exercise. This could carry some SEO weight because the site shares your niche.
- **Backlink 3**: appears on a sports blog in a basketball shoes buying guide. This could carry a good amount of SEO weight, because it suggests your page is highly relevant to the topic at hand. And that the link is genuinely useful to readers.

### Link Placement
The more prominent the backlink is on the page, the more valuable it can be for SEO.This is because Google may consider the likelihood that a reader will click on a link based on where it’s located.

For example, links that are in sidebars, in footers, and low on a page’s content may not be worth as much as those higher in the page’s body. Generally, it’s best if your backlink appears early on in the main body content.

### Anchor Text
Backlinks with descriptive anchor text (the clickable, linked text) can be better for SEO.

For example, a backlink with the anchor text “basketball shoes” clearly indicates what the linked page is about. Whereas generic anchor text like “click here” gives no useful context.
That said, it’s important that anchor text reads naturally.

### Nofollow, Sponsored, and UGC Attributes
Some links contain a nofollow attribute (or another attribute) that tells Google not to pass ranking strength to the linked page.
|**Link Attribute**|**Description**|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|rel=”nofollow”|Used to identify links that the publisher doesn’t want to endorse. Google is likely to respect the publisher’s wishes.|
|rel=”sponsored”|Used to identify links that were paid for by the linked site. Google ignores these links because they aren’t genuine endorsements.  |
|rel=”ugc”|Used to identify links that were placed by users (e.g., in comments sections). Google ignores them because they’re too easy to manipulate.  |

While they may drive brand awareness and referral traffic, these kinds of backlinks are unlikely to help your rankings.

Standard links that don’t contain a nofollow, sponsored, or UGC attribute are sometimes called follow links or dofollow links. These are the ones you want when building links for SEO.

## How To Build
### Earn Links
When you earn links, other websites link to yours without you asking them to. 

This can be extremely cost-effective. Plus, you don’t need to worry about the links violating Google’s link spam guidelines because you aren’t responsible for creating them.

The best way to earn links is to **create high-quality content** that people want to link to—i.e., link bait

Here are a few different types of content people tend to link to:
- Visual assets (infographics, charts, diagrams, etc.)
- Original research and data (industry studies, surveys, proprietary research, etc.)
- Online tools and calculators
- In-depth guides and tutorials

### Ask for Links
Asking for links is when you actively contact a person (or team) and persuade them to link from their website to yours.

There are two main reasons why they might link to you:  
- There’s something on your website that their audience will be interested in  
- To credit you where you’re mentioned in their content

### Add Links
Going to another website and **manually adding your link there isn’t a good way** to build backlinks. Because Google doesn’t want to count links that you have (or might have) placed yourself. 

That includes links added to:  
- Social media profiles
- Business directories
- Forums, communities, and Q&A sites (like Quora)  
- Blog comments
- User profile pages

You can still add links in these places. **To help drive referral traffic** to your website. But **not in an effort to generate SEO value**.

Otherwise, you may be engaging in link spam and harming your brand image.

### Buy Links
You should **not** buy SEO links that are intended to influence your rankings.

In other words, you should only pay for backlinks if they’re qualified with the rel=”sponsored” or rel=”nofollow” attribute. (Which tells search engines to ignore them.)


## Backlink Building Tactics
- Conduct Email Outreach
Email outreach is the process of reaching out to a website (or website representative) to persuade them to give you a backlink.

  It’s important because people can’t link to your content without discovering it. Even the best assets need to be promoted to attract links. 

- Become a Source

    If you work with reporters to provide information or assets, you may receive a backlink by way of attribution.
- Try Broken Link Building

    Broken link building is the process of finding backlinks that no longer work and persuading the publishers to replace them with working links to your site.

    It’s an effective tactic because no one wants to send visitors to broken pages. And you’re offering a convenient solution. 
- Create Linkable Assets

    A linkable asset is a piece of content that has good potential to earn backlinks naturally. Such as a tool, research report, or in-depth guide.
- Find Unlinked Brand Mentions

    An unlinked brand mention is when a website mentions you or your business without linking to you. 
    
- Analyze Competitor Backlinks

    Analyzing competitor backlinks helps you to replicate link building tactics that work for your rivals.

    And it can tell you:  

    - Which types of content tend to earn the most backlinks  
    - Who’s linking to others in your niche
- Reclaim Lost Backlinks

    Recovering backlinks that you lost (which can happen if the linking site updated the content, deleted the page, or redirected the page) is often easier than building links from scratch. Because the site was already willing to link to you in the first place.
- Do a Backlink Gap Analysis

    A backlink gap analysis reveals websites linking to your competitors but not to you.
