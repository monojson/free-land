# Always Sell Benefits Not Features

![steve jobs](/images/steve.png)

The phrase "Always sell benefits, not features" is a common principle in sales and marketing. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on how a product or service can improve the customer's life, rather than just listing its technical specifications or characteristics. 


### Understanding the Difference
**Features**: These are the factual descriptions of what a product or service can do. They are the specific attributes or functionalities of the product. For example, a smartphone's features might include a 12-megapixel camera, 128GB of storage, and a 6.5-inch display.

**Benefits**: These are the advantages or positive outcomes that customers experience as a result of using the product or service. Benefits answer the question "What's in it for me?" For example, the benefits of the smartphone might be the ability to take stunning photos (thanks to the high-resolution camera), store a large amount of data (due to the ample storage), and enjoy a great viewing experience (due to the large display).


### Why Focus on Benefits?
**Emotional Appeal**: Benefits tap into the emotions and desires of the customer. People often make purchasing decisions based on how a product will make them feel or how it will improve their life, rather than on technical specifications alone.

**Relevance**: Benefits explain why the features matter to the customer. They make the product relevant to the customer's needs and wants.

**Differentiation**: Benefits help differentiate your product from competitors by showing unique advantages that matter to the customer.


### Examples of Feature vs Benefit
**Feature**: The car has a fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon.

**Benefit**: Save money on gas and reduce your environmental footprint with our highly fuel-efficient car.

**Feature**: The software includes automated backup.

**Benefit**: Never worry about losing your data again; our software automatically backs up your files, keeping your information safe and secure.

**Feature**: The laptop has a lightweight design.

**Benefit**: Easily carry your laptop anywhere and work comfortably on the go with our ultra-lightweight design.


### How to Translate Features into Benefits
To effectively sell benefits, follow these steps:

**1. Identify the Feature:** Start by listing the features of your product or service.

**2. Ask "So What?"**: For each feature, ask yourself why it matters. What positive outcome does it provide?

**3. Frame the Benefit**: Articulate the benefit clearly, focusing on how it improves the customer's life or solves a problem they have.


### Practical Application
When crafting marketing messages or sales pitches:

**Know Your Audience**: Understand the needs, desires, and pain points of your target audience.

**Highlight Benefits in Communication**: In your ads, brochures, website, and sales conversations, emphasize the benefits more than the features.

**Use Testimonials and Case Studies**: Real-world examples and customer stories that highlight benefits can be very powerful.


### Conclusion
Focusing on benefits rather than features helps you connect with customers on an emotional level and clearly communicate the value of your product or service. It shifts the focus from what your product does to how it can make your customer's life better, which is a far more compelling proposition.
