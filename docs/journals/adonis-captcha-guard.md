# Integrate Cloudflare Turnstile and Google reCAPTCHA v3 into AdonisJS v6

![adonis](/images/adonis.png)

## Why
Recently, I needed to incorporate Cloudflare Turnstile service into my new project [U301](https://u301.com/), built on AdonisJS v6. Unfortunately, there were no existing packages available for this purpose. 

## How
I took the initiative to develop one from scratch. This package not only integrates Cloudflare Turnstile seamlessly but also extends support to Google reCAPTCHA v3. I’m thrilled to share that the AdonisJS community has embraced this solution, recognizing its value and reliability.

Integrating Cloudflare Turnstile or Google reCAPTCHA into your AdonisJS v6 project is now easier than ever! I’ve put together a comprehensive guide outlining the steps required for seamless integration. Simply follow the instructions outlined [in this documentation](https://packages.adonisjs.com/packages/adonis-captcha-guard), and you’ll be up and running in no time. If you encounter any issues or have questions along the way, feel free to reach out — I’m [here](https://github.com/monojson/adonis-captcha-guard/issues) to help.
