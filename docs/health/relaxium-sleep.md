# How To Get A Relaxium Sleep

### Don't Drink
Don't drink any alcohol, that's for sure. If you must have a drink, have it before 6pm. Alcohol may damage sleep quality more than any other factor we can control. Don't confuse the lethargy it produces with quality sleep.

### Eat less
Don't eat anything within 3 hours of bedtime, preferably longer. It's better to go to bed with a little hunger.

### Avoid electronics
Avoid irritating electronics from 2 hours before bed. If you have trouble falling asleep, try to avoid anything that involves a screen. If necessary, reduce the curtain blue light in the background.

### Keep mood steady
At least an hour or more before bed, avoid doing anything that might be distracting or provocative, such as reading work emails or checking social media. All of this makes the rumination, worry-prone area of our brain hum, and that's not what you want.

### Keep room cool
The room should be kept cool, preferably around 18 degrees Celsius. The bed should also be cool.Use a "cool" mattress or one of the many bed cooling devices. For those who can afford it, spend some time in the sauna or hot tub before bed. Once you're in a cool bed, the lowered body temperature signals to your brain that it's time to sleep. A hot bath or shower will also work.

### Keep room drak
Make the room completely dark. If possible, make the light so dark that you can't see your fingers. If this is not possible, an eye mask can be used.

### Get enough sleep
Giving yourself enough sleep is what sleep scientists call "slecpopportunity." That means sleeping at least eight hours, and preferably nine, before you need to wake up.

### Regular sleep schedule
Set your wake-up time and don't deviate from it, even on weekends. If you need flexibility, you can change your bedtime, but make it a priority to get at least enough sleep in bed each night
Eight hours.

### Don't obsess
Don't obsess over your sleep, especially if you're having trouble sleeping. If you need a clock by your bed, make sure it faces away from you so you can't see the numbers. Watching a clock can make it harder to fall asleep. If you find yourself worrying about poor sleep patterns, take a break from using sleep trackers.
